<A NAME="embed"><P><B>Code [embed]</B><P>
The embedded references are formatted as
<P>
pathname_1->pathname_2->pathname_3...
<P>
which indicates that pathname_1 is a string embedded in the
binary pointed to by pathname_2, which in turn is a string
embedded in pathname_3. Or, to read it the other way around,
pathname_3 refers to pathname_2 which refers to pathname_1.

See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.
<P>
The indicated pathname to an executable contains a component which is not
owned by root. This can enable an intruder to gain unauthorized privileges
if they are able to replace the binary. See the 'rationale' explanation
for a discussion of the reasons that executables run by root should be
owned by root.

See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.
<P>
The indicated pathname to a file or directory contains a component which
is not owned by root. This may indicate a vulnerability in the system.
It will be necessary to study the programs in which the pathname was
found to determine whether there is a problem.

The indicated executable is not owned by owned by root. This can
enable an intruder to gain unauthorized privileges if they are able to
overwrite the executable. See the 'rationale' explanation for a
discussion of the reasons that executables run by root should be owned
by root.

Note that if the executable is setuid to a non-root ID, then the
ownershop should *NOT* be changed to root unless the setuid bit
is also removed.
