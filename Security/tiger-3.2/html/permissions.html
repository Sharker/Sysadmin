<A NAME="perm003a"><P><B>Code [perm003a]</B><P>
The access permissions of the indicated file are incorrect. This may
indicate an intrusion has occurred. In any event, it is a serious security
problem and should be corrected immediately. The system should also be
checked for signs of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm003f"><P><B>Code [perm003f]</B><P>
The access permissions of the indicated file are incorrect. This may
create a vulnerability in the system. This should be corrected immediately.

</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm003w"><P><B>Code [perm003w]</B><P>
The access permissions of the indicated file are not what is considered
best for security. Unless you have a reason for not doing so, the permissions
should be corrected.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm004c"><P><B>Code [perm004c]</B><P>
No file permissions database can be found. This will prevent the
checks of file ownerships to be performed. This likely indicates
that a complete port has not been done for this platform.

</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm005a"><P><B>Code [perm005a]</B><P>
The /etc/security directory contains security information that should
not be accessible by non-root users. The owner should be root, and group
and world should have only search access (mode 711). The directory
unfortunately must be search-able because of some library routines which
check for the existence of the security.adjunct file. The files in the
directory should be mode 600.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm006w"><P><B>Code [perm006w]</B><P>
The configuration files (.login, .profile, etc) should be not be writable
by non-root users. In addition, the .rhosts file should not be readable
or writable by non-root users.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm007f"><P><B>Code [perm007f]</B><P>
The /etc/aliases, /etc/aliases.dir and /etc/aliases.pag files should not
be writable by non-root users. On SunOS 4 systems, these files are
shipped world writable. The permissions should be 644 on all three
files. If left writable, program aliases can be added which can
allow unauthorized access.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm008w"><P><B>Code [perm008w]</B><P>
The /etc/exports (or equivalent) file should not be writable by anyone
other than root. If a non-root user can modify the file, unauthorized
privileges can be obtained. There is also no reason for this file
to be readable by anyone other than root. Making it unreadable, reduces
the information available to an intruder attempting to gain privileged
access.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm009f"><P><B>Code [perm009f]</B><P>
The /etc/group file should not be writable by anyone other than root.
If a non-root user can modify the file, unauthorized privileges can
be obtained.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm010w"><P><B>Code [perm010w]</B><P>
The /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files (from Wietse Venema's
tcp_wrapper package) should not be writable by non-root users. If
they are writable, the protection provided by the package can be
bypassed. In addition, if all of the daemons protected by tcp_wrapper
run as `root', then the file does not need to be readable by non-root
users. Making the permissions 600, reduces the information available
to an intruder attempting to gain privileges. If any daemons are
run as non-root users though, this is not possible.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm011w"><P><B>Code [perm011w]</B><P>
The /etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/hosts.lpd files define trusted hosts.
The hosts.equiv file defines the trusted hosts for the Berkeley 'R'
commands (rsh, rlogin), while the hosts.lpd file defines trusted hosts
for the print system. If the hosts.equiv or hosts.lpd file is writable
by users other than root, then unauthorized privileges or access may
be gained. In addition, there is no reason for non-root users to be
able to read these files. Making them unreadable reduces the information
available to an intruder attempting to gain privileges.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm012w"><P><B>Code [perm012w]</B><P>
The /etc/inetd.conf file defines the network daemons controlled by
`inetd'. If this file is writable by non-root users, then unauthorized
access can be obtained. In addition, it is not necessary that this file
be readable by non-root users. Making the file unreadable reduces the
information available to an intruder attempting to gain privileges.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm013f"><P><B>Code [perm013f]</B><P>
The /etc/netgroup file defines network groups which consist of machines
and users. Allowing write access can allow unauthorized access or
privileges.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm014a"><P><B>Code [perm014a]</B><P>
If /etc/passwd is writable by non-root users, then new login id's
can be added to the system. Unauthorized access or privileges can
easily be obtained. If the file is world writable, this is a possible
indication that the system has been compromised. The system should
be checked for other signs of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm015f"><P><B>Code [perm015f]</B><P>
The 'rc.*' scripts are executed during system startup. If they are
writable by non-root users, then unauthorized access or privileges can
be obtained. In addition, there is no need for these files to be world
readable. Making them unreadable reduces the information available to
an intruder attempting to gain privileges.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm016w"><P><B>Code [perm016w]</B><P>
The /etc/resolv.conf file is used to designate where Domain Name
Service is to be obtained. If this file is writable by non-root
users, then unauthorized access or privileges may be obtained.
This file does need to be world readable however.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm017w"><P><B>Code [perm017w]</B><P>
The /etc/utmp file should not be writable by non-root users. This
is a security vulnerability. Unfortunately, on SunOS 4 systems, the
SunView and OpenWindows 'cmdtool' and 'shelltool' programs do not
function correctly if it is not. If you are not using these tools,
then you should set the permissions to 644.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm018a"><P><B>Code [perm018a]</B><P>
The root directory should be protected from changes by non-root users.
If the directory is writable by non-root users, unauthorized access
or privileges can be obtained.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm019a"><P><B>Code [perm019a]</B><P>
The /etc directory should be owned by root and should not be writable
by group or world. As shipped, SunOS 4 systems have the /etc directory
owned by the user `bin'. This is *incorrect*.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm020w"><P><B>Code [perm020w]</B><P>
The indicated disk device file is world readable, writable or both. This
allows the file access controls to be bypassed. The world permissions
should be removed.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm021w"><P><B>Code [perm021w]</B><P>
The indicated disk device file is group readable, writable or both by the
indicated group. This allows users in this group to bypass the file
access controls. Many systems allow a group such as `operator' to have
read access so that backups can be performed. Group write access is
*not* needed and should be removed. If backups are performed by the
`root' account, then group read permissions are not needed and should
be removed.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm022w"><P><B>Code [perm022w]</B><P>
The indicated disk device file is not owned by `root'. This allows the
owner of the disk device to bypass the systems file access controls.
The owner should be changed to `root'.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm023a"><P><B>Code [perm023a]</B><P>
The indicated file has the setuid bit set, but it should not have it.
This should be changed by using 'chmod u-s file' where 'file' is the
indicated file. The system should be checked for signs of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm024a"><P><B>Code [perm024a]</B><P>
The indicated file has the setgid (group) bit set, but it should not
have it. This should be changed by using 'chmod g-s file' where 'file'
is the indicated file. The system should be checked for signs of
intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="perm025w"><P><B>Code [perm025w]</B><P>
If the 'arp' program is 'setgid', it can be used to read files that a user
normally should not be able to read. On many systems, this includes
/dev/kmem and /dev/mem. Turning the 'setgid' bit off will result in the
loss of 'arp -a' functionality for a normal user account. (On SunOS 5.x
systems, even this functionality isn't lost... there is no reason for
'arp' to be setgid). This is a minor loss of functionality.
