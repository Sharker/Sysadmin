<A NAME="pass002w"><P><B>Code [pass002w]</B><P>
The listed userid (uid) occurs more than once in the same file. This
usually indicates a configuration problem and should be corrected. On
many systems, uid 0 (zero) and uid 1 (one) are often used for multiple
usernames. It is usually to completely disable all of the usernames
except for `root' for uid zero and all of the usernames for uid one.

<A NAME="pass004w"><P><B>Code [pass004w]</B><P>
The listed username occurs in separate password sources, but the userid
(uid) is different in them. This can lead to unexpected access to
resources if not corrected.

<A NAME="pass006w"><P><B>Code [pass006w]</B><P>
The password files have integrity issues as found by 'pwck -r'. This
can lead to looping of password manipulation programs and to authentication
or login issues if not corrected.

<A NAME="pass007w"><P><B>Code [pass007w]</B><P>
Some password controls or constraints are missing. These should be be
applied to all users via their /etc/login.defs configuration values.

<A NAME="pass008e"><P><B>Code [pass008e]</B><P>
The password file was not generated and cannot be analysed. This might
probably happen due to Tiger not running with full administrative access.
