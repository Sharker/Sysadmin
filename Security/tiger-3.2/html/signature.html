No signature database was found. This likely indicates that a complete
port of the security checking system has not been done for this system.
It may also indicate an incorrect configuration of the security checking
system.
<P>
Because the signature database does not exist, it will not be possible
to perform the checks for altered binaries and installed security
patches.

The signature for the indicated file matches a signature obtained
from a binary known to have been altered. This indicates that the
system has been compromised. The system should be checked for other
signs of intrusion and cleaned up. The indicated binary should be
replaced from distribution media.

<A NAME="sig003w"><P><B>Code [sig003w]</B><P>
The signature for the indicated file is recognized as the signature
from a binary for which either a security patch exists, or a newer
version of the security patch exists. The file is out of date and
should be replaced with one from the indicated patch.

<A NAME="sig004w"><P><B>Code [sig004w]</B><P>
No match was found for the signature of the indicated file. This
indicates either a local modification has been performed, replacing
the binary, or that the file has been altered by an intruder. If
you are not aware of any local modifications, you should check this
carefully.

The /usr/kvm/modload program can be used to gain super-user
privileges. Sun Patch ID 101200 provides a fix for this. The
documentation for the patch indicates that it is for SunOS 4.1.3, but
examination of the SunOS 4.1.2 /usr/kvm/modload indicates it suffers
from the same problem. I do not know whether the modload binary in
101200 will work with SunOS 4.1.2.

This is an additional fix to /usr/5bin/su. See 'sig006w' for
information on the initial fixes.

/usr/5bin/su sets the default path with '.' as the first search
directory. This opens the system up to trojan programs. Sun

The remote shell daemon on Linux 0.99.12 from TAMU (and other distributions)
does not understand shadow passwords. If an entry in /etc/passwd (not
/etc/shadow) has a null password field, a remote shell will succeed from
any where to that account. The 'passwd' command does *not* sanity check this
field when changing the password. As a result, the 'root' account has a
null password field, allowing anyone to remote shell in as root. To fix
this problem, place a '*' in the password field in /etc/passwd.
