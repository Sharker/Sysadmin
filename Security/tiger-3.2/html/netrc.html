The indicated .netrc file is readable by others and contains entries
for login ID's that are not anonymous FTP, and these entries contain
passwords. This provides login information to intruders, allowing
them to compromise the remote site. The read permissions should be
removed immediately. It is also not a good idea to have the passwords
in the file. Unless absolutely necessary, these entries should
be deleted.
