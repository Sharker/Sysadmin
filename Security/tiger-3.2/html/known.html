The indicated file is a directory. The file is a known location used
by intruders. This should be considered a sign that this system
has been compromised. The system should be checked for other signs
of intrusion and cleaned up.

The indicated window server directory contains files other than UNIX
data-gram sockets. This should be considered a sign that this system
has been compromised. The system should be checked for other signs
of intrusion and cleaned up.

<A NAME="kis004w"><P><B>Code [kis004w]</B><P>
The 'lost+found' directory (one exists for each file system) is used
by the `fsck' program as a directory for re-linking "dangling" files
during the file system check. These directories should be checked when
a file system check is not clean and files recovered from here. This
directory is also used by intruders to store files, as it is often
ignored. The files found here should be checked. If any unusual files
are found, the system should be checked for other signs of intrusion.
In any event, the 'lost+found' directories should be kept clean.

The /bin/login program appears to have a back-door installed. The
program should be compared against distribution media and replaced
if it has been altered. The system should be checked for other
signs of intrusion and cleaned.

<A NAME="kis006e"><P><B>Code [kis006e]</B><P>
The attempt to compile the program to check the setuid() system
call failed for some reason. This will prevent the test from
occurring.

<A NAME="kis007a"><P><B>Code [kis007a]</B><P>
The setuid() system call succeeded even though the user was not
root. This most likely indicates that the system has been compromised
and the OS altered. A new kernel should be installed and the machine
rebooted.

The indicated file in the system mail spool does not have a name which
matches the owner. This indicates either an attempt to create a mailbox
for another user (allowing someone else to read that persons mail),
or that the mail spool is being used to store files. These files should
be checked, and if unusual, the system should be examined for other signs
of intrusion.
