<A NAME="inet001e"><P><B>Code [inet001e]</B><P>
One or the other of the two listed files are unavailable. These
files are required for the checks to proceed. This either indicates
an incorrect configuration, or that a port to this machine has not
been completed.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet002f"><P><B>Code [inet002f]</B><P>
The indicated service is assigned to the wrong port. This indicates
either a misconfiguration in the services database, or a possible
sign of an intrusion. This should be checked and corrected. If it
is not apparent why it is like this, the system should be checked
for other signs of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet003f"><P><B>Code [inet003f]</B><P>
The indicated port number is assigned to the wrong service. This
indicates either a misconfiguration in the services database, or a
possible sign of an intrusion. This should be checked and corrected.
If it is not apparent why it is like this, the system should be
checked for other signs of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet004i"><P><B>Code [inet004i]</B><P>
The indicated service has been added to the services database
as distributed. These are normal output, but you should be
familiar with what is there, and note any changes.

<A NAME="inet005w"><P><B>Code [inet005w]</B><P>
'inetd' is using the indicated binary for the listed service instead
of what is normally expected there. Unexpected differences should
be checked, and if anything unusual is found, the system should
be checked for other signs of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet006f"><P><B>Code [inet006f]</B><P>
The 'rexd' service is very insecure and should never be enabled.
It should be disabled immediately by editing the inetd.conf file
and removing the 'rexd' entry, and sending a HUP signal to the
'inetd' process.
<P>
For AIX systems, CERT Advisory CA-92:05 is applicable.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet007w"><P><B>Code [inet007w]</B><P>
'inetd' is using the indicated executable for a port other than
what would normally be expected for this port. This may indicate
a backdoor into the system and should be checked. If anything
unusual is found, the system should be checked for other signs
of intrusion.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet008"><P><B>Code [inet008]</B><P>
The owner of the indicated executable is not 'root'. The owner
of the executable should be root in order to reduce the possibility
of it being altered or replaced.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet009"><P><B>Code [inet009]</B><P>
The indicated executable is group writable, world writable or both.
The executable should be owned by root and writable only by the
owner. This reduces the possibility of it being altered or replaced.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet010i"><P><B>Code [inet010i]</B><P>
The program listed in the `inetd' configuration file does not
exist or is not executable.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet011i"><P><B>Code [inet011i]</B><P>
The listed entry is a local addition to the `inetd.conf' file.
This should be checked to see if it is a valid addition. If it
is not, it should be removed.

<A NAME="inet014i"><P><B>Code [inet014i]</B><P>
The listed entry was protected by tcp wrappers by the default installation
and is currently protected this way too. This is a good thing!
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet015i"><P><B>Code [inet015i]</B><P>
The listed entry has been modified in order for it to be protected
by using tcp wrappers. This has been changed from default installation
(which did not provide it) but is probably a better setup.
<PRE>










</PRE><HR>
<A NAME="inet016f"><P><B>Code [inet016f]</B><P>
The listed entry was protected by tcp wrappers by the systema but has,
for some unknown reason, changed to no longer be protected by them. Make
sure that the service is secured since, if not using tcp wrappers,
access control for it might be disabled.
