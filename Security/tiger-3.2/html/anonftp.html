<A NAME="ftp001i"><P><B>Code [ftp001i]</B><P>
There doesn't appear to be an anonymous ftp setup on this machine,
and hence there is nothing to check.

<A NAME="ftp002a"><P><B>Code [ftp002a]</B><P>
There is a .rhosts file in the top level of the anonymous ftp
directories. This can allow unauthorized 'rlogin's or 'rsh's to
occur to the ftp account. This indicates a possible intrusion.
The contents of the file are listed immediately following the message.
The machine should be checked for other signs of intrusion and should
be cleaned up. The .rhosts file should be removed.

<A NAME="ftp003w"><P><B>Code [ftp003w]</B><P>
The etc/passwd file in the anonymous ftp directories appears to
contain valid entries in the password field. If these are valid,
then the file can be retrieved and a password cracking program
run against it. The etc/passwd file in the anonymous ftp directories
should simply have a '*' in the password field, and should only
include entries for the 'ftp' and 'root' accounts.

<A NAME="ftp004w"><P><B>Code [ftp004w]</B><P>
Anonymous ftp appears to be setup on this machine, but the directory
field in the password field is empty. This exposes the entire machine
to anonymous users, allowing them to browse looking for security
problems. A specific (not /) directory should be specified.

<A NAME="ftp005f"><P><B>Code [ftp005f]</B><P>
The anonymous ftp directory is set to the root directory (/). This
exposes the entire machine to anonymous users, allowing them to browse
looking for security problems. The directory should be set to a
hierarchy that doesn't allow access to system or user files.

<A NAME="ftp006w"><P><B>Code [ftp006w]</B><P>
Anonymous ftp appears to be setup, but the directory indicated as
the ftp directory does not exist. This indicates either a misconfiguration
or an old setup. This should be corrected by either correcting the
directory name, or deleting the ftp account.

The indicated file is owned by the 'ftp' account, but is not currently
writable. Since it is often possible to change the permissions through
ftp, it may still be possible to modify the file, possibly allowing
an intruder to gain unauthorized access. The indicated file should
be owned by 'root' and not writable by group or world.
