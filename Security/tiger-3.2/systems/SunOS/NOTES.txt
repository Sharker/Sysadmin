Notes for SunOS / Solaris
-------------------------

Sun provides the following information that can be useful
for local security testing:

- The Solaris (tm) Fingerpint Database (sfpDB)
  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/fileFingerprints.pl
  which can be used to determine if system binaries have been
  compromised.
  Some tools have been released by Glenn Brunette and Brad Powell
  (sfpDB Companion and sfpDB Sidekick) and are availabe at
  http://www.sun.com/blueprint/tools
  (there is currently a Web inteface, but probably the full content
  will be published someday)

- The Patchdiag Cross Reference tool. The file patchdiag.xref can be
  downloaded from 
  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/patchDownload.pl?target=patchdiag.xref&method=H

The following scripts have not been tested fully yet and are 
provided as sample:

- check_listeningprocs: determine listening proccesses using
	PFILES instead of NETSTAT or LSOF (in order to dermine
	which processeses or users are runing the listeners)

- check_patches: determine if the patches of the system needed
	are properly installed.
