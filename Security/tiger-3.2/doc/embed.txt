%embed
The embedded references are formatted as

pathname_1->pathname_2->pathname_3...

which indicates that pathname_1 is a string embedded in the
binary pointed to by pathname_2, which in turn is a string
embedded in pathname_3.  Or, to read it the other way around,
pathname_3 refers to pathname_2 which refers to pathname_1.
%embed001w
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The indicated pathname to an executable contains a component which is not
owned by root.  This can enable an intruder to gain unauthorized privileges
if they are able to replace the binary.  See the 'rationale' explanation
for a discussion of the reasons that executables run by root should be
owned by root.
%embed001i
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The indicated pathname to a file or directory contains a component which
is not owned by root.  This may indicate a vulnerability in the system.
It will be necessary to study the programs in which the pathname was
found to determine whether there is a problem.
%embed002w
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The indicated executable is not owned by owned by root.  This can
enable an intruder to gain unauthorized privileges if they are able to
overwrite the executable.  See the 'rationale' explanation for a
discussion of the reasons that executables run by root should be owned
by root.

Note that if the executable is setuid to a non-root ID, then the
ownershop should *NOT* be changed to root unless the setuid bit
is also removed.
%embed002i
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The indicated file or directory is not owned by root.  This may
indicate a vulnerability in the system.  It will be necessary to study
the programs in which the pathname was found to determine whether
there is a problem.
%embed003w
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The indicated pathname to an executable contains a component which
is group writable, world writable or both.  This can enable an intruder
to gain unauthorized privileges if they are able to replace the
executable.
%embed003i
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The indicated pathname to a file or directory contains a component
which is group writable, world writable or both.  This may indicate a
vulnerability in the system.  It will be necessary to study the file
and programs in which the pathname was found to determine whether
there is a problem.
%embed004w
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The executable is group writable, world writable or both.  This can
enable an intruder to gain unauthorized privileges if they are able to
overwrite the executable.
%embed003i
See the 'embed' explanation for an explanation of the format of the
embedded references.

The file or directory is group writable, world writable or both.  This
may indicate a vulnerability in the system.  It will be necessary to
