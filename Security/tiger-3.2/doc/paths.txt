%path001w
The indicated file is in root's PATH, and is group writable, world
writable or both.  This can allow Trojan horse programs or viruses to be
planted into these executables and spread by `root'.  The group
and world write permissions should be removed.
%path002w
The indicated file is in root's PATH, but is not owned by root.  This
can allow Trojan horse programs or viruses to be planted into these
executables and spread by `root'.  Often these executables are owned by
`bin', `uucp' or other system accounts.  If these commands are never
used by root, then this is not a problem.  If they are, you should
consider changing the owner to `root'. Because of SMI's recent decission
to install most /usr/sbin/* and /usr/bin/* executables
as owned by `bin', this account will not flag a warning.
%path003i
No PATH variable could be extracted from the indicated file.  This either
indicates that the PATH is not set in the file, or that the file is too
complex to be able to extract it.
%path004w
The PATH variable from the indicated initialization file for `root' puts `.'
(dot) in the PATH.  Having dot in `root's path can allow Trojan horse
programs to be unknowingly executed by root.

%path005w
The PATH variable from the indicated user and initialization file
contains the `.' (dot) directory, but it is not the last component.
This can cause Trojan horse programs to be executed.  It is recommended
that `.' not be in the PATH (especially for `root'), but if it is included,
it should be the last directory listed in the PATH variable.

%path006w
The indicated directory from a user's PATH variable is writable.  This can
allow commands in this directory to be replaced with Trojan horse programs.
Note that this can be reported even if the directory itself does not have
group or world write permissions.  This message is generated if any directory
component of the pathname is writable (the directory itself can be replaced
with a new, writable one if a directory higher up is writable).

%path007w
The indicated directory is in `root's PATH, but is not owned by 'root'.
This can allow Trojan horse programs to be placed into any executables
in this directory.  The ownership of the directory should be changed
to `root'.
%path008i
The indicated setuid program is in root's PATH, but is not owned by
root.  Since it is setuid to a user other than root, there usually is
no solution for this.  You should be aware of these though, as they
can allow Trojan horse programs or viruses to be planted into these
executables and spread by `root'.  Often these executables are owned
by `bin', `uucp' or other system accounts.  If these commands are
never used by root, then this is not a problem.
%path009w
An initial setting of the PATH variable should be setup in the default
locations for shell login programs (/etc/profile, /etc/csh.login, etc.).
