%pass001w
The listed username occurs more than once in the same file.  This
indicates a configuration problem and should be corrected.
%pass002w
The listed userid (uid) occurs more than once in the same file.  This
usually indicates a configuration problem and should be corrected.  On
many systems, uid 0 (zero) and uid 1 (one) are often used for multiple
usernames.  It is usually to completely disable all of the usernames
except for `root' for uid zero and all of the usernames for uid one.
%pass003w
The listed entry does not have the correct number of fields.  This
indicates a configuration problem that should be corrected.
%pass004w
The listed username occurs in separate password sources, but the userid
(uid) is different in them.  This can lead to unexpected access to
resources if not corrected.
%pass005w
The listed userid (uid) occurs in separate password sources, but the
usernames are different.  This can lead to unexpected access to resources
if not corrected.
%pass006w
The password files have integrity issues as found by 'pwck -r'.  This
can lead to looping of password manipulation programs and to authentication
or login issues if not corrected.
%pass007w
Some password controls or constraints are missing.  These should be be
applied to all users via their /etc/login.defs configuration values.
%pass008e
The password file was not generated and cannot be analysed. This might
probably happen due to Tiger not running with full administrative access.
%pass009e
The format of a given configuration file used for user (or group) 
authentication has some inconsistency that might be a security vulnerability.
%pass010w
The listed groupname occurs more than once in the same file.  This
indicates a configuration problem and should be corrected.
