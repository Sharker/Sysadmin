%dev001
Tape devices used for backups should not have world permissions.
%dev002
Devices that have improper (world) permissions might be accessed by
any system user. This might open security holes if these are shared
devices or hold binaries (disks for example). The administrator should
properly set device access (using group configuration to provide
access to a device to multiple users, for example).
%boot01
The lilo configuration file (/etc/lilo.conf) should have permissions
limiting access to only the owner (usually root).
%boot02
The grub configuration file (/boot/grub/grub.conf) should have
permissions limiting access to only the owner (usually root).
%boot03
A boot loader configuration file could not be found.  That means
that neither /etc/lilo.conf nor /boot/grub/grub.conf exists.
%ptch01
AutoRPM has determined that there are updated packages waiting
to be installed.
%ptch02
apt-get has determined that there are updated packages waiting
to be installed.
%ptch03
The machine does not appear to be a RedHat or Debian system.
This test can currently only determine current patch levels
if it can find autorpm or apt-get.
%ptch04
No patch management tool could be found on the system.  
The scripts looks for autorpm followed by apt-get.  If either
one is found it is used to determine if updated packages
are available for your system.  This message indicates that
neither program was found on your system. 
%ptch05e
If the Tiger tool is not running as root it will probably not be
able to update the package database from the latest sources available.
Some errors might be printed on the output and the security check
will be done only on the current available list of packages (which
might not be up-to-date). Make sure that you are running the tool
as an administrative user.
%osv001
The operating system version appears to be less than RedHat 6.2
Due to security enhancements and fixes available in recent releases,
running an older version of RedHat is strongly discouraged.
%osv002
The operating system version appears to be less than Debian 2.1
Due to security enhancements and fixes available in recent releases,
running an older version of Debian is strongly discouraged.
%osv003
The machine does not appear to be a RedHat or Debian system.
This test can not suggest a recommended version number for your
operating system.
%osv004
The machine is running an unreleased version of Debian GNU/Linux.
This version is not supported by the security team so it might not
be up-to-date security wase (support is only provided for the latest
release). That is, "run at your own risk".
%sum001
The system does not appear to require a password during single-user
mode boot.  Either add a password to your boot loader or add the line:
~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin
to your /etc/inittab file.  This line should be added immeditaly before
the line containing "rc 0".
