%ftp001i
There doesn't appear to be an anonymous ftp setup on this machine,
and hence there is nothing to check.
%ftp002a
There is a .rhosts file in the top level of the anonymous ftp
directories.  This can allow unauthorized 'rlogin's or 'rsh's to
occur to the ftp account. This indicates a possible intrusion.
The contents of the file are listed immediately following the message.
The machine should be checked for other signs of intrusion and should
be cleaned up.  The .rhosts file should be removed.
%ftp003w
The etc/passwd file in the anonymous ftp directories appears to
contain valid entries in the password field.  If these are valid,
then the file can be retrieved and a password cracking program
run against it.  The etc/passwd file in the anonymous ftp directories
should simply have a '*' in the password field, and should only
include entries for the 'ftp' and 'root' accounts.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp004w
Anonymous ftp appears to be setup on this machine, but the directory
field in the password field is empty.  This exposes the entire machine
to anonymous users, allowing them to browse looking for security
problems.  A specific (not /) directory should be specified.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp005f
The anonymous ftp directory is set to the root directory (/).  This
exposes the entire machine to anonymous users, allowing them to browse
looking for security problems.  The directory should be set to a
hierarchy that doesn't allow access to system or user files.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp006w
Anonymous ftp appears to be setup, but the directory indicated as
the ftp directory does not exist.  This indicates either a misconfiguration
or an old setup.  This should be corrected by either correcting the
directory name, or deleting the ftp account.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp007f
The indicated file is owned by the 'ftp' account and is writable.  This
may allow unauthorized access to the machine.  The indicated file should
be owned by 'root' and not writable by group or world.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp007w
The indicated file is owned by the 'ftp' account and is writable.  This
allows anonymous ftp users to modify this file, possibly compromising
the system.  The indicated file should be owned by 'root' and not writable
by group or world.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp008f
The indicated file is owned by the 'ftp' account, but is not currently
writable.  Since it is often possible to change the permissions through
ftp, it may still be possible to modify the file, possibly allowing
an intruder to gain unauthorized access.  The indicated file should
be owned by 'root' and not writable by group or world.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp008w
The indicated file is owned by the 'ftp' account, but is not currently
writable.  Since it is often possible to change the permissions through

the system.  The indicated file should be owned by 'root' and not writable
by group or world.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp009w
The indicated file is not owned by root.  This may allow unauthorized
access to the system.  The owner of the file should be root and the
group and write permissions removed.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp010f
The indicated file is writable by the 'ftp' account.  This may allow
an intruder to gain unauthorized access.  The group and write permissions
should be removed.

See CERT advisory CA-93:10 for information on setting up an anonymous
FTP server.
%ftp010w
The indicated file is writable by the 'ftp' account.  This may allow
the system to be compromised.  The group and write permissions should be
removed.
