%nrc001f
The indicated .netrc file is readable by others and contains entries
for login ID's that are not anonymous FTP, and these entries contain
passwords.  This provides login information to intruders, allowing
them to compromise the remote site.  The read permissions should be
removed immediately.  It is also not a good idea to have the passwords
in the file.  Unless absolutely necessary, these entries should
be deleted.
%nrc002w
The indicated .netrc file contains entries for login ID's that are not
anonymous FTP, and these entries contain passwords.  The .netrc file
is not readable, but it is still not a good idea to have the passwords
in the file.  Unless absolutely necessary, these entries should be
deleted.

condition and should be checked out.
%nrc004a

that an intrusion has occurred.  The directory should be examined
for unusual files.  The system should also be checked for other
signs of intrusion.  The directory should be renamed or removed.
