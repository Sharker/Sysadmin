%sig001e
No signature database was found.  This likely indicates that a complete
port of the security checking system has not been done for this system.
It may also indicate an incorrect configuration of the security checking
system.

Because the signature database does not exist, it will not be possible
to perform the checks for altered binaries and installed security
patches.
%sig002a
The signature for the indicated file matches a signature obtained
from a binary known to have been altered.  This indicates that the
system has been compromised.  The system should be checked for other
signs of intrusion and cleaned up.  The indicated binary should be
replaced from distribution media.
%sig003w
The signature for the indicated file is recognized as the signature
from a binary for which either a security patch exists, or a newer
version of the security patch exists.  The file is out of date and
should be replaced with one from the indicated patch.
%sig004w
No match was found for the signature of the indicated file.  This
indicates either a local modification has been performed, replacing
the binary, or that the file has been altered by an intruder.  If
you are not aware of any local modifications, you should check this
carefully.
%sig005e
Something prevented the system from reading the indicated file.  This
should not occur if the security system is run from the root account
on a non-MLS system.

Sun Patch ID 100633 /bin/login, /bin/su, /usr/5bin/su (ARM)
%sig007a
The signature for the indicated file matches a signature obtained
from a binary known to have been altered.  This indicates that the
system has been compromised.  The system should be checked for other
signs of intrusion and cleaned up.  The indicated binary should be
replaced from distribution media.

A vulnerability exists in the NIS system for SunOS 4.x systems which
may allow NIS maps, including the passwd maps, to be obtained by any
host.  Sun Patch ID 100482 provides a fix for this.

CERT Advisory CA-91:20

A vulnerability exists in the 'rdist' command which can be exploited
to gain unauthorized privileges.  This vulnerability exists in most
versions of 'rdist' distributed before 1992.  Sun Patch ID 100383
provides a fix for this.

%sig011w
CERT Advisory CA-91:10a

A vulnerability exists in the print system (lpr, lpc, lpd, etc) on
SunOS 4.x systems which can allow a user to delete files they do
not own.  A fix for this vulnerability is provided in Sun Patch ID
100305.
%sig012w
CERT Advisory CA-91:09

A vulnerability exists in the rpc.mountd program which can allow
any host to access NFS exported file systems.  This occurs when the
length of the host access list for an entry exceeds 256 characters.
Sun Patch ID 100296 provides a fix for this.
%sig013w
A vulnerability exists in the expreserve utility for SunOS 4.1.1
systems which can be used to gain unauthorized privileges.  Expreserve
is used by the 'ex' and 'vi' editors for preserving files when the
editors terminate abnormally.  Sun Patch ID 100251 provides a fix
for this.  (obsoleted by by Sun Patch ID 101080, [sig014w])

CIAC Advisory D-16

A vulnerability exists in the expreserve utility for SunOS 4.1.1,
4.1.2, 4.1.3, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2 systems which can be used to gain
unauthorized privileges.  Expreserve is used by the 'ex' and 'vi'
editors for preserving files when the editors terminate abnormally.
Fixes for this for SunOS 4.x and 5.x are:

Sun Patch ID 101080 -- SunOS 4.x

Sun Patch ID 101119 -- SunOS 5.0

Sun Patch ID 101089 -- SunOS 5.1

A vulnerability exists in the /bin/mail and /bin/rmail utility for
SunOS 4.x systems which can be used to gain unauthorized privileges.
These programs are responsible for performing local mail delivery.
Sun Patch ID 100224 provides a fix for this.

CERT Advisory CA-93:15

A vulnerability exists in /usr/lib/sendmail which allows a remote
user to gain access to the system.

Sun Patch ID 100377-07 provides a fix for SunOS 4.x.

Sun Patch ID 100840-03 provides a fix for Solaris 2.1.

Sun Patch ID 101077-03 provides a fix for Solaris 2.2.

A vulnerability exists in the 'tar' utility which causes it to
place information from the passwd file in the archive set.  Archives
created with this version of 'tar' should not be distributed.

Sun Patch ID 100975-02 provides a fix for Solaris 2.1.

Sun Patch ID 101301-01 provides a fix for Solaris 2.2.

The /usr/kvm/modload program can be used to gain super-user
privileges.  Sun Patch ID 101200 provides a fix for this.  The
documentation for the patch indicates that it is for SunOS 4.1.3, but
examination of the SunOS 4.1.2 /usr/kvm/modload indicates it suffers
from the same problem.  I do not know whether the modload binary in
101200 will work with SunOS 4.1.2.
%sig019w
This is an additional fix to /usr/5bin/su.  See 'sig006w' for
information on the initial fixes.

/usr/5bin/su sets the default path with '.' as the first search
directory.  This opens the system up to trojan programs.  Sun
Patch Id 100630-02 provides a fix for this, in addition to those
discussed in 'sig006w'.  Refer to the README provided with the
patch for additional information concerning international sites.

Sun Patch ID 100630 /usr/5bin/su

On SunOS 5.2, the FTP daemon does not correctly verify that the user's
shell is valid.  As a result restricted accounts can login via FTP.

Sun Patch ID 101037 provides a fix for this.
%sig021w
The remote shell daemon on Linux 0.99.12 from TAMU (and other distributions)
does not understand shadow passwords.  If an entry in /etc/passwd (not
/etc/shadow) has a null password field, a remote shell will succeed from
any where to that account.  The 'passwd' command does *not* sanity check this
field when changing the password.  As a result, the 'root' account has a
null password field, allowing anyone to remote shell in as root.  To fix
this problem, place a '*' in the password field in /etc/passwd.
