tiger (3.2rc1-1) experimental; urgency=low
  * New upstream version 
     - False positives in services fixed (Closes: #132278)
     - Check_exports produces proper output (Closes: #162453)
     - Checks have been separated, now each check file prints it's
       comment (Closes: #165766)
     - Using the new ignore mechanism (better than the differential
       mechanism) this package now provides a baseline for Debian GNU/Linux, 
       hopefully this will make Matt test again this package :-) 
       (Closes: #164308, #172375)
     - The new ignore mechanism can now be used to avoid false positives,
       please customize as needed and read the notes on the 
       check_listeningprocs script (Closes: #136991)
     - Tigexp now gets modified by the Makefile (Closes: #189864)

  * Remove all the /var/log/tiger* files.. sorry for the mess :(
  * Added a new configuration note in order to ask the user for the
  removal of the previous files instead of removing them without asking.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu, 10 Oct 2002 12:48:25 +0200

tiger (3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release which includes some fixes for Debian bugs
  such as the "don't regenerate index" (Closes: #162590)
  * Made debian/rules update automatically the advisories file (which
  is now named debian_advisories so the previous chmod -x is not needed)
  * Automatically remove CVS dirs from the package (Closes: #154343)
  * Fixed bashisms in check_rcumask (Closes: #159444)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu, 25 Jul 2002 19:37:41 +0200

  * Updated to latest advisories.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Wed,  7 Aug 2002 10:33:47 +0200

tiger (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Linux' config file so that it sets LSGROUPS to nothing
  Due to a change in fileutils-4.1.1 which changed the standard
  behavior from "showing groups (but really doing nothing)" to
  "not showing the owner" ! (Closes: #155588)
  * Modified config to set the environment properly (this was the
  first workaround I tried for the previous bug, didn't fix it but
  it seems better to leave the locale's environment, just in case...)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Tue,  6 Aug 2002 17:06:01 +0200

tiger (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (based on savannah sources)
  * Fix in order for deb_checkmd5sums to work with all sources (it was
    limited due to a stupid bug)
  * Included latest DSA advisories
  * The new package provides a *very* short diff since changes regarding
  Debian are added to the upstream sources too.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Tue, 18 Jun 2002 13:28:18 +0200

tiger (2.2.4p2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a GPL header to all the important scripts/files used by the
    program (this means /, /scripts and /systems/{default,Linux}.
    This was a requirement for adding tiger as a new project to the
    savannah site.
    (probably next upstream version and Debian diff file will be 
    reduced since I intend to make the current Debian codebase 
    upstream's 2.2.4p3)
  * Added a new check scripts/check_runprocs (not currently configured to
    run since it needs sysadmin to configure tigerrc properly to determine
    which processes should be checked for)
  * Added some more information to the README.Debian file and rewrote
    some paragraphs.
  * Written some notes on how to use Tiger as a host IDS.
  * Chmod'ed many scripts in order to avoid lintian warnings.
  * Changed tiger so it first reads tigerrc in the local directory 
  (useful for testing the package without installing or to use the tar.gz
  in other environments)
  * Fixed the scripts/check_anon in order to test if ftphome/etc/passwd
  exists before grep'ing it.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Tue, 11 Jun 2002 23:02:12 +0200

tiger (2.2.4p2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incorporated TARA changes including:
    - Changed acc006 from FAIL to WARN (scripts/check_accounts).
    - Added -H option for HTML output.
    - Fixed scripts/check_cron for problems in entries.
    - Fixed scripts/check_exports to avoid false positives.
    - Fixed scripts/check_path due to problems with parse_csh.
    - Change scripts/check_perm to not warn when owner is bin and 
      changed calls of echo to message().
    - Made some of the changes provided by ARC in scripts/check_inetd
     (save for the SORT and JOIN changes which do not seem to work)
    - Changed scripts/sub/check_devs to work with IRIX 6.5
    - Changed GROUPS to GROUPSS as ARC team does since it (might)
      be a readonly variable in some shells (see bash(1)). Even though
     it is not used in any script.
     
  * Created a new package to provide all the scripts for other operating
    systems (Warning: you still need to compile the C programs: getpermit,
    md5, realpath, snefru and testsuid in those platforms for tiger to work
    fully).
  * Added Tiger_Check_SYSTEM to the distributed tigerrc
  * Added some Linux specific checks (gdm, xdm) in scripts/check_root
  * Created (new) systems/Linux/2/check_inittab script (for ctraltdel issue
    from Bastille).
  * Created (new) systems/Linux/2/check_rcumask script to check umask settings
    for the RC boot scripts.
  * Created (new) scripts/check_ftpusers script to check for administrative
    users that are allowed access in the FTP server.
  * Created (new) scripts/check_tcpd script to check for changes in the
    way inetd services are being protected through the use of tcp_wrappers.
    This script has been written based on check_inetd.
  * Modified scripts/check_sendmail to check for sendmail.cf's banner
  * Note. This new scripts have not been added to the cron entry. They will 
    only be run when running the 'tiger' script.

  * Written some README files: howto write modules (README.writemodules),.
    how much time does it take for scripts to run (README.time), and
    information on making signatures (README.signatures)
  
  * Changed tigexp to work if issued -F with no second argument

tiger (2.2.4p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the "I finally merged with Bryan Gartner's tarball" release
  * Cosmetic upgrade in version number due to too many changes in the
    sytem specific checks (AIX, Solaris et al.) derivated from tara sources.
    (thus this release might be labeled "new upstream", avoid 2.2.4p1 since
    it is used in TAMU's distribution)
  * Updated to latest debian DSAs.
  * Next release will have a new package to provide all the scripts for 
    other Operating systems so that a central Debian server can be used 
    with network filesystems as a single point of script distribution.
  * Included tara's new check and scripts checks: devices, issue, 
    lilo, logfiles, network, patches, release, root, rootdir, single and
    tripwire_run (this last one is deactivated in Debian since 
    the package, if installed, will do the checks)
  * Included the following systems without changes: AIX-4, IRIX-{4,5,6},
    Linux-1, Next-3, UNICOS, UNICOSMK
  * Instead of cp'ing all the SunOS files I ln -s all directories that
    were equal in order to reduce space in the source package (and diff)
  * Included the two new utils to convert into HTML
  * Changed realpath.c, snefru.c as described in CHANGES.ARSC
  * Merged patches from ASCR in files: check_accounts, check_cron, check_group,
    check_inetd, check_passwd, check_sendmail, systems/Linux/2/gen_mounts,
    tiger.
  * Updated scripts (not changed in Debian): check_path
  * Fixed Linux's gen_cron to include CRONSPOOL and fixed 
    systems/Linux/2/config to properly configure it (was set to /usr
    instead of /var) since it was not used this was not detected until now.
  * Updated the tiger configuration file (tigerrc)
  * Updated the manpage tiger.8
  * Moved check_listening from Linux-specific to all the generic location
    (since it will work in any UNIX system with NETSAT). 
    Changed tigerrc accordingly adding Tiger_Check_LISTENING variable
    and renaming the previous variables for this check.
  * De-activated RedHat's specific (and written in Perl) check_network
    script. TODO: rewrite it in shell script and remove RedHat-specific
    stuff.
  * Moved the Linux specific checks provided by Paul Telford to
    systems/Linux/2/ since they are not appropiate to other systems
    (for consistency)
  * Fixed check_release as provided by Paul Telford (some typos and not
    correctly programmed)
  * Applied some of the changes described in the Changes.ARSC. It seems these
    were not included in the TARA distribution (for some reason).
    REMINDER: ask for these to the ARSC team.
  * Fixed check_sendmail's pattern matching (wrong reports on dates) and made
    it properly Y2k.
  * Fixed (again) the postinst... let's see if I get it right this time...
  * Moved the FQDN check from 'tiger' to 'config' (since it is used by both
    tiger and tigercron)

tiger (2.2.4-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the "Yes, I was on vacation fixing bugs release (I)"
  * Applied patch Marcel that fixes some long-standing issues, did not change
    BASEDIR to basedir since it should work that way but *did* change typo
    which made diff's against previous run not to work (Closes: #139221)
  * Fixed Linux/2/gen_export_sets tpo (Closes: #139667)
  * Modified Linux/2/config so that findcmd() looks first for binaries generated
    by Tiger, including realpath (Closes: #139669)
  * Modified deb_checkmd5sum to "understand" locale.nopurge configuration.
    Currently experimental, but seems to work fine. Admins that fixed this
    through templates will, however, have to remake them (Closes: #123891)
  * Since realpath's Linux does not work as tiger's realpath -d, removed it
    from the Recommends: (use tiger's instead)
  * Added -u option in gen_listeningprocs (UDP sockets are not shown if using
    netstat, this was an unreported bug)
  * Added warning to the tigerrc regarding user's Tiger_ListeningProc (will
    not work if using NETSTAT and not LSOF)
  * Added the Tiger_Check_EVERYLISTENING option which will report if a
    service is listening on *all* interfaces, default is Y, if set to 'N'
    only processes run by users different from Tiger_ListeningProcs will be
    reported. Changed gen_listeningprocs for this to work (Closes: #138855)
  * Changed the name of gen_listeningprocs to check_listeningprocs (more
    proper and consistent)
  * Provided some more documentation in the tiger.8 manpage detailing which
    modules are available
  * Check_listeningprocs has been modified to allow it to not warn on
    processes when using the Tiger_Listening_ValidProc variable in 
    /etc/tigerrc this allows admins to remove processes which can dynamically
    change TCP/IP port (Closes: #134085)
  * Changed Tiger_Listening_Proc to Tiger_Listening_ValidUser (more precise).
    WARNING: Postinst will not change this from the config file! 
  * The changes introduced in check_listeningprocs as well as the 
    check-against-template behavior configuration will (hopefully) reduce greatly 
    false positives if properly configured (Closes: #126635)
  * Set Tiger_Check_CRACK to 'N' by default and removed cron job since this 
    feature does not work. Added 'john' Recommends: since the Debian package
    does provide that feature by itself.
  * Added check_sendmail to SCRIPTS in the Makefile (it was not being
    installed, unreported bug)

  * Fixed check_known's grep which did not work on Solaris boxes...
  * Fixed systems/SunOS/ so that it can find the CUT command too
  * Changed scripts/check_known to use HEAD instead of TAIL in the
  mail spool checks (Closes: #135202)
  * Changed scripts/check_anon to check if the ftp user is in the
  system's passwords (Closes: #135205)
  * Added proper dependecies (based on systems/Linux/2/config) 
  (Closes: #128796)
  * Added an Tiger_Output_FQDN option so that it uses hostname -f
  as the system name for reports (Closes: #129526)
  * Added version.h to the package in order for tiger to determine
  the current Tiger version.
  * Fixed debconf note (Closes: #136298)
  * Added an alternative (and better) template location: /etc/tiger/templates
  * Updated Debian DSA's

tiger (2.2.4-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the deb_nopackfiles so it uses -x -F and will not be confused by
  strange file names (i.e. [) this also avoids filenames being interpreted
  as regular expressions (Closes: #126569)
  * Fixed deb_md5sums so it does not follow symlinks (sometimes they get
  followed to unexistant files)
  * Modified check_accounts so that it does not give warnings for accounts
  of uid < 999 (system accounts in Debian GNU/Linux) by introducing a new
  tigerrc variable (Tiger_Accounts_Trust)
  * Added tiger-2.2.3p1-patch from TAMU
  * Added some more info to the debian/copyright file
  * Added the fix_tiger_GROUPS.sh script to a "contrib" area
  * Added -p option to netstat and reduced output with grep -v STREAM :)
  * Improved gen_listeningprocs so only uniq processes are shown listening
  to the same socket, also, UDP sockets are now listed too with lsof and
  netstat
  * Fixed check_inetd so it does not do a 'set' when an empty line is found
  * Modified difflogs intensively since it was not working properly, added
  a new feature and varialbes in tigerrc so that cron jobs can be compared
  against "template" (policy-compliant?) runs. This can reduce false positives
  even if they cannot be reduced in a given module.
  * Added configurable Tiger_Listening_Procs for gen_listeningprocs to 
  customize for local security policy (Closes: #126635)
  * Added debconf note (borrowed from snort) to configure mails receiver
  (Closes: #122256)
  * Added debconf note to warn the user to adapt to security policy
  * Fixed lintian errors.
  * Update DSAs

  * Updated services file (Closes: #122338)
  * Fixed file control list (Closes: #122337)
  * Updated Debian Security Advisories

  non-optimize method (using grep, cut, et al in the /var/lib/dpkg area)
  * Fixed Debian specific scripts (==)
  * Fixed Linux's gen_export_sets (nobody yelled yet, but it did not work

  * Changed file_access_list for Linux so /etc/aliases can be world readable (Closes: #112159)

  * Changed MAILER from mail to sendmail so we can send 'Subject' and 'From'

  * Fixed tigercron so mails get sent properly with a From line, since the
  information is now sent to the mailer and not to the Tiger log no 
  mails should be sent out if they do not include useful information

  * Added Recommends on mail transport agent since it's used for cron reporting.

  Linux's /etc/exports
