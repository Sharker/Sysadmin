(sent on  Fri Jun 14 09:07:00 2002 to the Tiger-TAMU mailing list 
at <tiger@net.tamu.edu> but, unfortunately, didn't make it to list readers,
included here for the convenience of Tiger users)

Dear Tiger users (is anyone listening?)

First let me introduce myself, I'm Javier Fernández-Sanguino, I'm
currently a Debian developer (and have been for around 5 years) and
main author of the "Debian Securing Manual" [0]).  I have contributed
(and still do) to many free software projects besides Debian including
Freeradius, Nessus, Bastille and have been also very active in spanish
translation teams.

Since my professional interest has shifted from pure free software
towards free software security, I have been actively watching (and
contributing) in different areas. Free software is currently very
competitive in many security areas, just to mention a few: network
intrusion detection (Snort), vulnerability scanners (Nessus),
hardening software (Bastille) and high-availability (the linux virtual
server project and VRRP developments). However, one of the areas free
software was falling behind was on host-based intrusion detection
tools.

Deciding this could be easily fixed I started working with Tiger last
year, integrating it into Debian, once this was done (it was really
easy) I started adding new security checks, first Debian-specific and,
later on, more general. Bryan Gartner from HP around november 7th 2001
asked the TAMU team, the TARA team at ARSC and myself if there was any
active work on integrating the forks (TARA's and Debian's) or a single
development tree people could work on.

The answer to that question was, at the time, no. Now it's _yes_.

After some work on my behalf, I have integrated TARA's, HP's and
Debian's into the same source-code base. This is currently being
distributed by Debian as tiger-2.2.4p2-4 [1] In order to avoid
fragmentation I have started a new Savannah project for Tiger [2]
which currently holds:

- two mailing lists (users' and developers')
- a bug tracking system (in order to avoid using Debian's [3] for
bugs not related to Debian packages)
- a CVS repository (which now holds the common source code base) [4]
- a download area [5]
- News and other miscellanea

I would like to suggest users to subscribe to the user mailing list to
discuss issues regarding this (new) codebase. And if anyone is
interested in becoming a developer for this project, feel free to
subscribe to the developer's mailing list too.

I have branded this release tiger '3.0' so as to avoid confusion
regarding previous TAMU (or ARSC's TARA) releases.

	Best regards

	Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña
