Note: the up-to-date TODO list is maintained through Savannah's Task Manager
(http://savannah.nongnu.org/pm/?group=tiger) this list is provided for the
commodity of those browsing the source code

- Automate the creation of new tar.gz's including a revision that sets
  the proper exec bits to all needed files.

- Full security audit of the code, I dislike the use of 'eval' (used by
the util/ scripts in the haveallof() function, but seems safe). I would not
like to see posts in Bugtraq related to tiger.
(such as http://lists.insecure.org/lists/bugtraq/1998/Jun/0160.html
from Marc Heuse dated Fri Jun 26 1998 - 08:24:17 BST)

- Update signatures using TAMU's (and maybe knowngoods.org's) signature
database.
See http://savannah.nongnu.org/pm/task.php?group_project_id=472&group_id=2247&func=browse

- Improve support non-Linux OSs
https://savannah.nongnu.org/pm/task.php?group_id=2247&group_project_id=632

- Modified the rhosts check so that it will check for shosts files too

- Modify check_network to include hosts.lpd in the tests

- Add .bash_profile into check_path

- Create the following scripts:
     - Detect promiscous mode
     - Check root $HOME files (might be redundant with check_path's)
     - Do alias give the same as check_aliases?
     - writable/executable check + word writable? (in find_files)
     - Check for SAMBA configuration (checklist #20 SANS):
     	. encrypted passwords.
	. 600 /etc/smbpasswd or /etc/samba/smbpasswd
	. shares enabled/disabled
	. guest access
	. create mask (770)
     - Check newer FTP (/etc/ftpaccess in newer Linux systems, ftpusers
       is deprecated) see checklist #22 of SANS.
     - The check_inetd script should be improved to warn if echo/chargen..
       services are enabled (SANS unix checklist #3 and Linux #4)
     - SANS unix checklist #18 
	. Solaris /etc/system (noexec stack)
	. Solaris locked accounts (#18 and #21)
	. Solaris default/login
	. Solaris /etc/default/kbd
     - Partition checks (in Linux /etc/fstab, in Solars /etc/vfstab,
       if there is a /usr, /opt then read-only, if /var
       or /tmp nosuid. Separate /var,/usr,/tmp from /
     - Solaris /etc/notrouter to disable
     - Rootkits check, like chkrootkit 
     Reference: 
     http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2002/02/07/rootkits.html

     - Suggested by Bob Hall:
        * Check if any local file systems are being exported to
       'localhost'. Also check if the local host is in a netgroups
        entry in its own exports file.
	* Look for (unexpected) normal files under /dev.
	(Note: include in 'check_devices')
	* Check for user startup files that call 'umask' with weak
	settings. (Should be 022 or 027.)
	(Note: include in 'check_umask' using GENPASSWDSETS)
	* Check that '-' is not the first character in a /etc/hosts.equiv
	/etc/hosts.lpd, or .rhosts files. Also check for a '+' entry in
	hosts.lpd file. 
	(Note: include in 'check_rhosts')
	* If a system allows it, check for an /etc/shells file and look
	if the permitted shells are in the system directories.

- Possible integration with other security tools:
 	- Tripwire: the 'tripwire_run' script has not been tested thoroughly
	  (mainly because in Debian it is already configured to execute
	  regular checks standalone)
	- Crack: same for 'crack_run' (and for the same reason)
	- Other integrity checkers: aide, samhain, integrit...
	- Other password crackers: john
	- Logcheckers: swatch, logcheck, loganalysis, snort-logcheck
        Tiger currently does not do any log checking (see below)
	I'm not sure if Tiger should provide a new one or re-use 
	existing ones and include them as an 'external' program to run 
	through a Tiger module.  The benefit of using an accepted and use 
	log analysis tool is that Tiger can benefit from the database of 
	signatures of known attacks/non-issues. The problem is that the 
	sysadmin has to install yet another tool (if he is not using an OS 
	that already includes them) and, probably, some other stuff 
	(like Perl) on which the tool itself is based.

	- User anaylisis: sac, hostsentry (part of Abacus, but non-free)
	- Network checks: Arpwatch, Snort

- Compare checks against other tools'
	- Bastille/Titan: verify that each thing that they 'fix' (harden)
		is checked by Tiger. Provide a relationship of modules in
		each and Tiger checks (at README.sources)
	- CIS benchmark: verify that each "scoring" check is also done
		at Tiger through a check module.
	- OpenBSD or SuSE security checks (DONE)
	- SAINT/SARA: which do some local checks (on NFS for example)

NOTE: Tiger modular behaviour makes it difficult to share data but it's easier
to make simple checks than if using other monolythic tools (like CIS's, 
OpenBSD's or SuSE's)

- Implement IDMEF to send message on alerts. Consider the use of the XML
  library available at  http://www.silicondefense.com/idwg/snort-idmef/

- Consider sending encrypted mail. Check  http://karl.jorgensen.com/smash/
  or add 'gpg -e -a ' in tigercron

- Implementation of a generic OVAL interpreter: http://oval.mitre.org

- Checks need to have a timeout otherwise some checks like 'check_patches'
  (which depend on net access) will never end on a normal
  Tiger run.
