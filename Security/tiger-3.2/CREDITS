Several ideas and checks (i.e. check_cron, check_path) are derived
from Dan Farmer's COPS package.  Thanks for letting me rummage
around in COPS Dan!

Several checks are derived from Dave Safford's 'secure_sun' script.

Thanks to

Art Ferruzzi for pointing out that 'tiger' would check the permissions
on a symbolic link instead of what it was pointing to.

Dave Duchscher for repeatedly pointing out my inability to get the
signatures right for SunOS 4.1.3

Steve Rikli for also pointing out discrepancies in the signatures
file and advice on IRIX.

Dan Farmer for suggestions and allowing me to browse COPS for ideas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
William McVey et al of the Purdue CC provided the signatures for
     NeXT 3.1.

Steve Rikli of the College of Architecture, Texas A&M, provided
     the signatures for IRIX 4.0.5.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goran Larsson (hoh@lorelei.approve.se) for suggesting a way of
improving performance of 'tiger' as well as making it more robust.
The use of 'ls ... | awk' to get file ownership and permissions is
slow and unreliable (fields occasionally bump up against one another).
Though I wasn't able to use Goran's program (stat) without butchering
the code, I was able to use the suggeston.  Anyone starting from
scratch might want to look at 'stat' (contact Goran for availability).
