For starters
------------

'tiger' is a set of scripts that scan a Un*x system looking for
security problems, in the same fashion as Dan Farmer's COPS.  'tiger'
was originally developed to provide a check of UNIX systems on the A&M
campus that want to be accessed from off campus (clearance through the
packet filter).  As such, they needed something that *anyone* could run
if they could figure out how to get it down to their machine.

If you just want to run it, without regards to time considerations,
then just 'cd' into the tiger directory, and run './tiger' as 'root'.

The 'tigerrc' file is set up for a generic host, and enables all checks.
You can customize this file as needed.

(Or use the '-c' switch to use an alternate tigerrc file as of 2.2.2)

Please read the file USING for more information on how to use Tiger.
And read the file COPYING for legal stuff.

If you have any thing to say about 'tiger', please let us know (see
below).  New things to check, how to improve things, *anything*, send 
it in... if you think someone else has already sent in a bug report, 
suggestion, etc., send it in anyway... the more times someone hits us
over the head with something, the more likely it is to get fix/included...

Needs
-----

Tiger needs a standard POSIX shell to run, a C compiler if you wish to compile
the binaries used and some other (optional) utilities, including the standard
UNIX file utilities and text utilities (the GNU versions work fine for this).


Mailing lists
-------------

There are now two maillings list available for the 'tiger' at
savannah.gnu.org. These two mailing lists are:

- a user's mailing list: tiger-user@mail.freesoftware.fsf.org
    Dedicated to users of the Tiger tool, feel free to ask here any questions
    on how to run the tool, configure it or adapt it to your system.
    http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/tiger-user

- a developer's mailing list:  tiger-devel@mail.freesoftware.fsf.org
    If you want to help us improve Tiger this is where all discussion on 
    improvements on the tool take place.
    http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/tiger-devel

Note that the previous mailing list (at 'majordomo@net.tamu.edu') does
no longer work.

Availability
-------------

The latest versions of Tiger can be downloaded from Savannah at
http://savannah.gnu.org/files/?group=tiger

Previous versions are available at the "TAMU Security Tools: Tiger" page
http://www.net.tamu.edu/network/tools/tiger.html

You can browse the CVS code at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/tiger/tiger/

More information on the project, including bug tracking, task manager, etc.

Latest signatures
-----------------

You can check to see if you have the latest digital signatures
for the system(s) you are checking.  There are some signature files 
available on anonymous FTP at

      net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/tiger-sigs/*

The util/installsigs script can be used to install the updated
signatures.  As of Tiger 2.2.2, installsigs is also capable
of installing signatures for new OS releases (not new platforms
or major releases though).

Note however, that these signatures have not been updated for quite some
time (and might not be up-to-date with your current system). If you can
provide newer signatures please submit them to the developer's mailing
list.

History
-------

Tiger was originally developed by the A&M campus of the Texas University,
it was written at the same time that COPS, SATAN and Internet Scanner were.
Eventually, after the 2.2.4 version, which was released in 1994, development
of Tiger stalled.

Three different forks evolved after Tiger: TARA (developed by Advanced
Research Computing, available at http://www-arc.com/tara), one internally
developed by the HP corporation by Bryan Gartner and the last one developed 
for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino.

These forks were merged on may 2002 and in june 2002 the new source code,
now labeled as the 3.0 release, was published at the Savannah site.
The 3.1 release was distributed in october 2002, it was considered
an unstable release and included some new checks, a new autoconf script
for automatic configuration, but mostly included  fixes from
bugs found after testing Tiger in Debian GNU/Linux and in other 
operating systems. Over 2200 lines of code and documentation were included
in this release.
